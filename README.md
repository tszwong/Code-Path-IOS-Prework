## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
YouTube:
1. video preview
2. picture-in-picture
3. hold screen to speed up video

Instagram:
1. holding share post button for post sharing shorcuts
2. double tap comment to like
3. bookmark posts

Apple Music:
1. holding down on a song and creating a radio station based on the song selected
2. curated playlists based on songs listened to recently
3. karaoke-styled lyric display

Robinhood:
1. UI changes from light to dark theme based on hours of the market
2. sliding up to complete buy/sell transactions
3. stock watch list

WeChat:
1. massive gif selection + option to add your own
2. convert voice-to-text messages
3. scan QR-code to add friends

An improvement to the Robinhood trading app I would like to see or build would be to include advanced analytic dashboards with AI-powered insights that allow users to visualize their portfolio performance, market trends, and simulate models based on potential trades. These added features would add another dimension to an already amazing app with great UI/UX features and would also allow users to get more information about how they are investing!

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
The biggest challenge was getting used to using the Xcode interface as well as the swift language since both were completely new to me.
